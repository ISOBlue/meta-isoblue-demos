********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.6 Beta 2 (June 30, 2016)
- U-Boot boot loader:
  - synchronize/improve memory options
  - update: make set<media>update self contained
  - net: increase maximum frame size to accommodate VLAN packets
  - read kernel and device tree from UBI volumes instead of rootfs
  - add RN5T567 PMIC support which enables reliable board reset
  - runtime detection of i.MX 7Solo/Dual to construct device tree name
  - add fdt_board variable and construct device tree name with carrier board name
    (e.g. imx7d-colibri-eval-v3.dtb)
  - fixed crash when starting USB on i.MX 7Solo
  - increase maximum temperature for booting linux
- Linux kernel:
  - updated to 4.1.15 LTS long term stable Linux kernel as part of NXP/Freescale's
    1.1.0 GA release
  - renamed device trees to add carrier board name as part of the device tree
    (e.g. imx7d-colibri-eval-v3.dtb)
  - resynchronized resistive touch driver AD7879 with upstream version
  - use PMIC for board reset (on reboot)
  - fix poweroff
  - fix clock control when Cortex-M4 is running
  - add MCP2515 and spidev to device tree (the former being the default)
  - added support for TouchRevolution Fusion capacitive multi-touch controller
- Linux user-space:
  - trdx-extra.inc: add iperf3 to all images
  - florence: update to latest version 0.5.4, build without sound and drop
    gstreamer 0.10 dependency
  - alsa-state: add asound.state for Colibri iMX7 modules
- OpenEmbedded build system:
  - further clean-up update.sh update script
  - angstrom-qt5-x11-image: add a recipe which deploys qt5 and starts a demo

- sources git.toradex.com tag Colibri_iMX7_LinuxImageV2.6Beta2_20160701
  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_imx_4.1.15_1.1.0_ga
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Note:
- A new boot schema using static UBI volumes has been introduced. Therefore
  downgrading is not directly possible. To downgrade a module, the UBI
  partition needs to be cleared manually using "nand erase.part ubi".

Known Issues:
- display resolution can be set in the device tree
- flashing the ubifs rootfs with U-Boot may fail depending on HW

Linux Image V2.6 Alpha 1 (March 15, 2016)
- U-Boot boot loader:
  - initial release
- Linux kernel:
  - initial release
- Linux user-space:
  - initial release
  - uses ARMv7 hard-float Thumb2 builds (armv7at2hf-vfp-neon)

- sources git.toradex.com tag Colibri_iMX7_LinuxImageV2.6Alpha1_20160315
  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_imx_3.14.52_1.1.0_ga
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Known Issues:
- poweroff and reboot does not work as expected
- display resolution can be set in the device tree
- flashing the ubifs rootfs with U-Boot may fail depending on HW
- FreeRTOS firmwares for Cortex-M4 core cause Linux to freeze during boot-up
  (resolved in latest kernel version toradex_imx_3.14.52_1.1.0_ga-next branch)

********************************************************************************
Notes:
- 115200 baud serial debug console on UARTA aka FFUART (lower X25 on EvalBoards
  resp. X27 on V3.1a depending on JP17/19, X13 on Iris) without any handshake
- user account: root with empty password
- UBIFS flash root file system
- opkg package manager

    environment (e.g. install ia32-libs on 64-bit Ubuntu) and awk (e.g. install
    gawk on Ubuntu)
