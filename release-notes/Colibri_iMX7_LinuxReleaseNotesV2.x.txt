Linux Image V2.6.1 Beta 1 (September 29, 2016)

- U-Boot boot loader:
  - backport patches needed if compiling with GCC 6
  - autodetect SoC and set soc environment variable accordingly
  - set soc environment variable also in recovery mode (#20568)
  - patch device tree with serial number, product id and revision properties to
    make that information available in Linux
  - configure PMIC for suspend/sleep modes
  - fix writing of first firmware copy
  - print warning about upcoming NAND change:
	WARNING: This module uses an early tapeout/stepping
	of the i.MX 7 SoC which suffers a NAND flash issue
	requiring a software workaround. This U-Boot version
	still implements this workaround, but future U-Boot
	versions provided by Toradex will not use the
	workaround anymore. You must use a newer Colibri
	iMX7 (V1.1B or later) to use future software
	versions. For evaluation and testing purposes it will
	be possible to keep the current U-Boot and only
	update the kernel and root filesystem.
- Linux kernel:
  - merge changes from latest NXP release 4.1.15_1.2.0_ga
  - backport patches needed if compiling with GCC 6
  - enable audio clock earlier (and pinmux MCLK) to properly fix initialization
  - enable USB power (USBH_PEN) also on Colibri iMX7 Solo (required for Aster/
    Orchid/Viola carrier boards)
  - honour native-mode in display timings node
  - add SODIMM pin 45 as wake-up key
  - control BL_ON (using the PWM backlight drivers enable-gpios property)
  - add PWM polarity support (#18164)
  - disable internal RTC on Colibri iMX7 Solo (currently not functioning)
  - enable USB OTG device/host detection on USBC (#19050)
  - improve pinmuxing (disable conflicting pinmux on multiplexed pins and fix
    conflicting pinmux on pins which are pulled on carrier board)
  - keep 240MHz system clock on which allows to start the Cortex-M4 core via
    JTAG
  - synchronize defconfig (#19484)
- Linux user-space:
  - none
- OpenEmbedded build system:
  - split meta-toradex into BSP layers meta-toradex-bsp-common and
    meta-toradex-nxp as well as the software layer meta-toradex-demos
  - rename the parent directory from stuff to layers
  - mv from build/out*/deploy to deploy
  - rename TMPDIR from out to tmp
  - deploy qt5 tools into the sdk as part of optional angstrom-qt5-x11-image.bb

  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Known Issues:
- display resolution can be set in the device tree
- flashing the ubifs rootfs with U-Boot may fail on V1.0 HW

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.6 Beta 2 (June 30, 2016)
- U-Boot boot loader:
  - synchronize/improve memory options
  - update: make set<media>update self contained
  - net: increase maximum frame size to accommodate VLAN packets
  - read kernel and device tree from UBI volumes instead of rootfs
  - add RN5T567 PMIC support which enables reliable board reset
  - runtime detection of i.MX 7Solo/Dual to construct device tree name
  - add fdt_board variable and construct device tree name with carrier board
    name (e.g. imx7d-colibri-eval-v3.dtb)
  - fixed crash when starting USB on i.MX 7Solo
  - increase maximum temperature for booting linux
- Linux kernel:
  - updated to 4.1.15 LTS long term stable Linux kernel as part of
    NXP/Freescale's 1.0.0 GA release
  - renamed device trees to add carrier board name as part of the device tree
    (e.g. imx7d-colibri-eval-v3.dtb)
  - resynchronized resistive touch driver AD7879 with upstream version
  - use PMIC for board reset (on reboot)
  - fix poweroff
  - fix clock control when Cortex-M4 is running
  - add MCP2515 and spidev to device tree (the former being the default)
  - added support for TouchRevolution Fusion capacitive multi-touch controller
- Linux user-space:
  - trdx-extra.inc: add iperf3 to all images
  - florence: update to latest version 0.5.4, build without sound and drop
    gstreamer 0.10 dependency
  - alsa-state: add asound.state for Colibri iMX7 modules
- OpenEmbedded build system:
  - further clean-up update.sh update script
  - angstrom-qt5-x11-image: add a recipe which deploys qt5 and starts a demo

- sources git.toradex.com tag Colibri_iMX7_LinuxImageV2.6Beta2_20160701
  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Note:
- A new boot schema using static UBI volumes has been introduced. Therefore
  downgrading is not directly possible. To downgrade a module, the UBI
  partition needs to be cleared manually using "nand erase.part ubi".

Known Issues:
- display resolution can be set in the device tree
- flashing the ubifs rootfs with U-Boot may fail depending on HW
