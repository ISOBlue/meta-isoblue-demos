  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_imx_3.10.17_1.0.0_ga
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2014.04-toradex

Known Issues:
- connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec, so that
    neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic
    connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
- on first boot the resizing process adversely affects system performance for
    the first few minutes until completed
- Display resolution can be set for some output configurations, set the U-Boot
    environment variable vidargs accordingly. Some vidargs_xx variables
    provided for reference.
- backlight PWM BKL_PWM (hard-coded to 0 in U-Boot > full brightness on an EDT
    display).
- X uses only the fb0 device
- initial rootfs must fit in RAM, i.e. it must not be greater than ~900MB

    X29 depending on JP10/12, X22 on Ixora) without any handshake
- user account: root with empty password
- eMMC: partition 1: vfat with kernel, partition 2 ext3 root file system
- opkg package manager
- HDMI aka DVI-D: not all pixel clock frequencies allow for HDMI audio
- Linux host used for update preparation requires proper 32-bit execution
    environment (e.g. install ia32-libs on 64-bit Ubuntu) and awk (e.g. install
    gawk on Ubuntu)

  - serial console debug UART1
  - I2C via /dev/i2c-X
  - 8-bit MMC card mmc1
  - 4-bit SD card mmc2
  - HDMI audio
  - analogue audio playback and capture, resistive touch
    - audio noise is high, workaround is to set headphone volume to maximum and
        use the DAC volume
  - S/PDIF
  - SPI via /dev/spidev32766.0 aka SPI1 and /dev/spidev32765.0 aka SPI2
  - custom Ethernet MAC Address

  - Firefox browser
  - Gstreamer playback
  - OpenGL, but thermal issues if running full speed
  - LXDE
  - resize rootfs partition to full eMMC capacity
- Display:
  - only first output used by X11
  - dual output on HDMI and LVDS, both in 1920x1080
  - single output on EDT 7" Display
  - single output to analog RGB, aka VGA output

******************************************
eMMC Boot: Apalis iMX6Q 1GB V1.0a (Sample)
******************************************

Initial Preparation:
- download and extract Apalis_iMX6_LinuxImageVx.yz.tar.bz2 package with root
    permissions
- use any VFAT formatted SD resp. uSD card with at least 1000 MB of free space
- run update.sh script with optional -o argument pointing to mount point of
    above mentioned card

Flash eMMC:
- EvalBoard V1.0a
  - connect serial debug console to lower X28 or X29 using null modem RS-232
      or regular USB cable
  - insert above prepared SD card into MMC SDIO-socket (X18)
- Ixora V1.0a
  - connect serial debug console to X22 using null modem RS-232 cable and a
      10 pin IDC to 9 pin D-sub male connector. (DTK or Intel standard)
  - insert above prepared SD card into SD card/MMC SDIO-socket (X10)
- Boot to U-Boot prompt and start the update:
  - apply power or reset
  - hit any key to stop auto booting
  - use 'run setupdate' U-Boot command and then
  - use 'run update' U-Boot command
- If you updated from an older Image. (without a device tree)
  - power cycle or reset and hit any key to stop auto booting
    - use 'printenv' to get your current u-boot environment
    - use 'env default -a' to set the u-boot environment to its default value
	- optionally change the environment to your needs

Boot from eMMC:
- EvalBoard V1.0a or Ixora V1.0a
- power cycle
- upon first boot post-install scripts are run which takes around 2 minutes,
    please be patient

If the boot loader on the module got corrupted this recovers it by loading U-Boot
  over USB into the module's RAM and executing it there:
- EvalBoard V1.0a
  - connect USB micro A/B (X49) or USB B (X50) to development workstation using
      micro or regular USB cable
  - connect serial debug console as stated above
- Ixora V1.0a
  - connect USB micro A/B (X9) to development workstation using regular micro USB
      cable
  - make sure JP2 is removed and nothing is connected to the lower USB host port
      X8
  - for more information please consult Ixora datasheet section 3.3 and chapter 4
  - connect serial debug console as stated above
- have the module in recovery mode and load U-Boot over USB to the module's RAM:
  - lsusb should show a 15a2:0054 Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. device if
      the module is in recovery mode
  - if you have a 32-bit Linux host, replace imx_flash/imx_usb with its 32-bit
      version imx_flash/imx_usb.m32 i.e. sudo mv imx_flash/imx_usb
      imx_flash/imx_usb.m64; sudo ln -s imx_usb.m32 imx_flash/imx_usb
  - run ./update.sh -d
  - stop at the U-Boot prompt and begin the update as stated above
