  - add generic Toradex config block handling, print exact product description,
    board revision and serial number to the console

    serial-number, toradex,board-rev and toradex,product-id)
  - add command to restore Toradex config block ("cfgblock create")
  - display the Toradex logo, output preference: env var 'panel' | HDMI | Parallel RGB
  - enabled gpio command line interface
  - enabled DFU and Mass Storage on USB client, currently slow performance
  - update procedure now searches for an image on SD card, USB Mass Storage, TFTP server
- Linux kernel:
  - added support for Analog Camera Module
  - enable optional AHCI/SATA driver module
- Linux user-space:
  - update OpenEmbedded from daisy to dizzy:
    - glibc 2.20 (instead of eglibc)
    - systemd 2.18
    - Xorg 1.14.7
    - updated various LXDE packages to newer versions

  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_imx_3.10.17_1.0.0_ga
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Note:
- mount point names changed from /media/<block device name> to /media/<label>

Known Issues:
- some USB Thumb drivers don't work well in U-Boot
- USB hub on Evaluation Board not enabled in U-Boot
- connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec, so that
    neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic
    connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
- on first boot the resizing process adversely affects system performance for
    the first few minutes until completed
- Display resolution can be set for some output configurations, set the U-Boot
    environment variable vidargs accordingly.
- X uses only the fb0 device
- flash_eth.img requires manual splitting of the root.ext3 file.
    see the apalis-imx6_bin/flash_eth.scr script
- SATA drives not mounted automatically
    workaround 1: click its icon in the file manager
    workaround 2: mkdir <mountpoint>; mount /dev/<sata partition> <mountpoint>
- Desktop integration of video playback uses wrong escaping, always plays
    fullscreen .local/share/applications/gst-launch.desktop

******************************************************************************
eMMC Boot: Apalis iMX6Q 1GB V1.0a (Sample), Apalis iMX6D 512MB V1.1a (Sample), 
           Apalis iMX6Q 1GB V1.1a (Sample), Apalis iMX6Q 2GB IT V1.1a (Sample)
******************************************************************************
Note: recompile U-Boot with apalis_imx6q2g config for Apalis iMX6Q 2GB IT V1.1a

Initial Preparation:
- download and extract Apalis_iMX6_LinuxImageVx.yz.tar.bz2 package with root
    permissions
- use any VFAT formatted SD resp. micro SD card with at least 1000 MB of free
    space
- run update.sh script with -o argument pointing to mount point of
    above mentioned card

Flash eMMC:
- EvalBoard V1.0a
  - depending on JP10/12 connect serial debug console to lower X28 or X29 using
      null modem RS-232 or regular USB cable
  - insert above prepared SD card into SD/MMC 8bit (X18) or SD/MMC 4bit (X19) socket
- Ixora V1.0a
  - connect serial debug console to X22 using null modem RS-232 cable and a
      10 pin IDC to 9 pin D-sub male connector. (DTK or Intel standard)
  - insert above prepared micro SD card into SD card socket (X10)
  - if you update from a V2.2 image either use an EvalBoard for update or use
    on Ixora the U-Boot command:
	  setenv drive 2
	  setenv setupdate 'fatload mmc ${drive}:1 ${loadaddr} flash_mmc.img; source ${loadaddr}'
	  save
- Boot to U-Boot prompt and start the update:
  - apply power or reset
  - hit any key to stop auto booting
  - use 'run setupdate' U-Boot command and then
  - use 'run update' U-Boot command
    for "Apalis iMX6Q 2GB IT V1.1a" use 'run update_it' instead
- If you updated from an older image. (without a device tree)
  - power cycle or reset and hit any key to stop auto booting
    - use 'printenv' to get your current u-boot environment
    - use 'env default -a' to set the u-boot environment to its default value
    - optionally change the environment to your needs
    - use 'saveenv' to make the changes permanent
- Update a single component
  - U-Boot
    use 'run setupdate' and then 'run update_uboot'
    for "Apalis iMX6Q 2GB IT V1.1a" use 'run update_uboot_it' instead
  - Kernel or Linux Device Tree
    use 'run setupdate' and then 'run update_kernel' or 'run update_fdt' respectively

Boot from eMMC:
- above given update command should automatically perform a soft re-boot upon successful completion
- optionally power cycle
- upon first boot post-install scripts are run which takes around 2 minutes,
    please be patient

If the boot loader on the module got corrupted this recovers it by loading U-Boot
  over USB into the module's RAM and executing it there:
- EvalBoard V1.0a
  - connect USB micro A/B (X49) or USB B (X50) to development workstation using
      micro or regular USB cable
  - connect serial debug console as stated above
- Ixora V1.0a
  - connect USB micro A/B (X9) to development workstation using regular micro USB
      cable
  - make sure JP2 is removed and nothing is connected to the lower USB host port
      X8
  - for more information please consult Ixora datasheet section 3.3 and chapter 4
  - connect serial debug console as stated above
- have the module in recovery mode and load U-Boot over USB to the module's RAM:
  - lsusb should show a 15a2:0054 Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. device if
      the module is in recovery mode
  - run ./update.sh -d
  - stop at the U-Boot prompt and begin the update as stated above
