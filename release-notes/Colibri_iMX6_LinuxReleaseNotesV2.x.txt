Linux Image V2.4 Beta 1 (May 18, 2015)
- U-Boot:
  - update to U-Boot 2015.04
  - add generic Toradex config block handling, print exact product description,
    board revision and serial number to the console
  - create device-tree properties which make board information
    available from within Linux userspace through procfs (/proc/device-tree/
    serial-number, toradex,board-rev and toradex,product-id)
  - add command to restore Toradex config block ("cfgblock create")
  - display the Toradex logo, output preference: env var 'panel' | HDMI | Parallel RGB
  - enabled gpio command line interface
  - enabled DFU and Mass Storage on USB client, currently slow performance
  - update procedure now searches for an image on SD card, USB Mass Storage, TFTP server
- Linux kernel:
  - added support for Analog Camera Module, requires dedicated device-tree
      imx6dl-colibri-cam-eval-v3
- Linux user-space:
  - update OpenEmbedded from daisy to dizzy:
    - glibc 2.20 (instead of eglibc)
    - systemd 2.18
    - Xorg 1.14.7
    - updated various LXDE packages to newer versions
  - replace full NTP daemon with systemd's NTP client only systemd-timesyncd
  - blacklist USB RNDIS for connman, use systemd-networkd to configure RDNIS
    network interface (new standard IP of the module is 192.168.11.1!)
  - enable BusyBox resize command to resize the terminal on serial console

- sources git.toradex.com tag Colibri_iMX6_LinuxImageV2.4Beta1_20150518
  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_imx_3.10.17_1.0.0_ga
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Note:
- mount point names changed from /media/<block device name> to /media/<label>

Known Issues:
- some USB Thumb drivers don't work well in U-Boot
- connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec, so that
    neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic
    connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
- on first boot the resizing process adversely affects system performance for
    the first few minutes until completed
- Display resolution can be set for some output configurations, set the U-Boot
    environment variable vidargs accordingly.
- X uses only the fb0 device
- flash_eth.img requires manual splitting of the root.ext3 file.
    see the colibri-imx6_bin/flash_eth.scr script
- Desktop integration of video playback uses wrong escaping, always plays
    fullscreen .local/share/applications/gst-launch.desktop

********************************************************************************

**************************************************************************
eMMC Boot: Colibri iMX6S 256MB V1.0a (Sample), iMX6DL 512MB V1.0a (Sample)
**************************************************************************

Initial Preparation:
- download and extract Colibri_iMX6_LinuxImageVx.yz.tar.bz2 package with root
    permissions
- use any VFAT formatted SD resp. micro SD card with at least 1000 MB of free
    space
- run update.sh script with -o argument pointing to mount point of
    above mentioned card

Flash eMMC:
- EvalBoard V3.1a
  - depending on JP17/19 connect serial debug console to UARTA aka FFUART
      (lower X25) using null modem RS-232 cable resp. X27 using a regular USB
      cable
  - insert above prepared SD card into SD/MMC socket (X15)
- Iris V1.1a
  - connect serial debug console to UARTA aka FFUART X13 using null modem RS-232 cable and a
      10 pin IDC to 9 pin D-sub male connector. (DTK or Intel standard)
  - insert above prepared micro SD card into micro SD card socket (X10)
- Boot to U-Boot prompt and start the update:
  - apply power or reset
  - hit any key to stop auto booting
  - use 'run setupdate' U-Boot command and then
  - use 'run update' U-Boot command
- Update a single component
  - U-Boot
    use 'run setupdate' and then 'run update_uboot'
    use 'patch_ddr_size' to set the memory configuration depending on module
      type. (i.e the Colibri iMX6 DL will use only half of the available RAM)
  - Kernel or Linux Device Tree
    use 'run setupdate' and then 'run update_kernel' or 'run update_fdt' respectively

Boot from eMMC:
- above given update command should automatically perform a soft re-boot upon successful completion
- optionally power cycle
- upon first boot post-install scripts are run which takes around 2 minutes,
    please be patient

If the boot loader on the module got corrupted this recovers it by loading U-Boot
  over USB into the module's RAM and executing it there:
- EvalBoard V3.1a
  - connect USB B (X29) or USB micro A/B (X30) to development workstation using
      regular or micro USB cable
  - the jumper JP2 must be open
  - connect serial debug console as stated above
- Iris V1.1a
  - connect USB micro A/B (X12) to development workstation using regular micro USB
      cable
  - connect serial debug console as stated above
- make sure that the carrier board supports USB high speed
  - Iris & EvalBoard V3.1a OK, for other carrier boards see
      http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/usb-2.0-high-speed-%28480mbps%29
(see Colibri iMX6 Datasheet for recovery mode)
- have the module in recovery mode and load U-Boot over USB to the module's RAM:
  - lsusb should show a 15a2:0054 Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. device if
      the module is in recovery mode
  - run ./update.sh -d
  - stop at the U-Boot prompt and begin the update as stated above
